# Tasks
- [x] move functions in `move-and-log.py` to a separate file `trello.py`
- [ ] add configuration parameters to a separate file `config.py`
- [ ] generalize the directory structure used by the script (e.g., see line 162 in `move-and-log.py`: `destination = base_dir / '2015_reorg' / data_stream / data_type / name`
- [ ] generalize the organizational categories `data_stream` and `data_type` to `cat1` and `cat2`
- [x] run through instructions to make sure everything works on a fresh setup
- [ ] change main script to resolve all files and subdirectories in a directory before attempting to move that directory
